# PureLayout.Net

The ultimate layouting API for iOS is now available for Xamarin.iOS. PureLayout extends `UIView`/`NSView`, `NSArray`, and `NSLayoutConstraint` and brings productivity boosting enhancements with a refined Auto Layout API that is modeled after Apple's own frameworks. PureLayout.Net brings you 100% of the cross-platform Objective-C library to C# with Xamarin.iOS.

Writing your responsive iOS UIs in code behind can be a challenge when only using vanilla Auto Layout code. PureLayout.Net brings a developer-friendly approach for defining interface based on Auto Layout. Basing your UI code on PureLayout.Net will enable you and your team to write modularized view code which is designed for optimum performance and design flexibility.0

 While PureLayout can play allong very nicely with existing Storyboard layouts and can be used for simply adding or editing layout definitions it allows you to define your UI in a modularized, sharable and scalable fashion. To create a Xamarin.iOS project without using a storyboard follow the instructions on this page of the <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/application_fundamentals/ios_code_only/" target="_blank">Xamarin Developer guide</a>.
